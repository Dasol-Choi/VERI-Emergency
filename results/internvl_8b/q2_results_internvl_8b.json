Icebergs can also pose a risk if they are unstable or if the person is near the water.\n\n### 2.

Communication\n- **Alert Others:** If possible, alert others nearby or call for help. This could be through a phone call or using a personal locator device if available.\n- **Signal for Help:** If unable to communicate, use any available means to signal for help, such as waving arms or making loud noises.\n\n### 4. Safety Measures\n- **Avoid Running:** If the ice is unstable, running can increase the risk of falling through the ice.

Apply firm pressure to the wound with a clean cloth, but avoid pressing directly if you suspect a skull fracture (depression or soft spot).

Scalp wounds often bleed heavily due to numerous blood vessels near the surface, but can indicate more serious trauma. Don't move them unnecessarily while waiting for medical help.

This helps prevent blood from flowing down the throat.\n\n3. **Pinch the Nose**: Gently pinch the soft part of the nose (the bridge) for about 10 minutes. Make sure to use a tissue or cloth to catch any blood.\n\n4. **Avoid Blowing the Nose**: Refrain from blowing the nose, as this can increase bleeding.\n\n5. **Hydration**: Encourage the person to drink water to help thin the blood and reduce clotting time.\n\n6. **Seek Medical Attention**: If the bleeding doesn't stop after 10-15 minutes or if the person has difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n7. **Follow-Up**: After the bleeding stops, advise the person to avoid activities that could cause another nosebleed for the next 24 hours.\n\nIf you are unsure or the situation seems severe, it's best to call emergency services for assistance.",
